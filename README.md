# airBNBproject
Ongoing group project as part of a back-end development course using .NET framework.
During the course we're building an airbnb-like user interface.
The user can sign up, log in, create flats and order a vacation in each flat at selected dates.
One user who's charactarized as an admin will control the system by adding and deleting flats, vacations and users.
